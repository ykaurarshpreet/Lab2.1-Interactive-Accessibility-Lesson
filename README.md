Reflection

The most challenging accessibility enhancements I made were when changing
the HTML semantics since I wasn't aware of this phenomen before. I was used to 
placing the div element everywhere, so when I had to be more precise and choose specfic elemts I was confused. I didn't fully understand where each of the elements were supposed to be used but after messing around I realized what element should be used where. ARIA attributes improve the experience for users
relying on assistive technologies by providing additional information about the web content and UI. Since everything is defined appropriately and convenietly, it is much easier for users with disabilities to access and navigate, overall creating an inclusive environment. The tool I used to check the color contrast was called WebAIM Contrast Checker. I used this website, which has a tool to input the color hex value I was using in my css file to check if it passed the contrast ratio for my normal and large text. This helped in making sure I had the right shade and tone of colors to make it accessible for anyone to see my page clearly.

Recently learning about these elements having semantic meaning made it more clear to
me about how detailed work can improve someone's life .
